The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is a project focusing on [Global Approaches to Local Skills Development](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Strategy/Initiatives/Global_Approach_for_Local_Skill_Development) within and for the Wikimedia Movement. It establishes a sociotechnical platform for peer-to-peer connection and knowledge sharing to sustainably enable community-based capacity-building.

The aim is to create a methodology and service, which will serve as the structure for initiating mutual skills development globally, regionally, and locally. An interactive, online platform, backed by a database, will enable wikimedians to publish information about themselves, their affiliates, and informal groups. They will also be able to conduct searches, access information and to connect with each other in a way that reflects the Wiki's spirit and the Wikimedia Movement Strategy.

The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is available in Toolforge at https://capx.toolforge.org

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WikiMovimentoBrasil/capx-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd capx-backend
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    * On Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

    * On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Create the database and apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

This will create a SQLite file in your source directory.

7. Create a superuser to have full control over the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Install initial data:
   ```bash
   python manage.py loaddata fixtures/initial_data.json
   python manage.py loaddata fixtures/orgs.json
   ```

9. Create a ```.env``` with the following envvars

   ```bash
   SOCIAL_AUTH_MEDIAWIKI_KEY="<YOUR MEDIAWIKI OAUTH KEY>"
   SOCIAL_AUTH_MEDIAWIKI_SECRET="<YOUR MEDIAWIKI OAUTH SECRET>"
   SECRET_KEY="<CREATE YOUR OWN RANDOM KEY>"
   ```

To create a new OAuth app and key, go to https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:OAuthConsumerRegistration .  For local development, you can enable "This consumer is for use only by <your username>" and "User identify verification only".

10. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

You should now be able to access the project at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.
